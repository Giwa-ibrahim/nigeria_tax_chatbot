By the time you’re done reading this article, you’ll
know what’s changing. We’ll walk you through
what’s new in a way that actually makes sense -
what it means for your personal and/or business
finances, and the simple steps you can take to stay
compliant.
What’s the 2026 Nigeria Tax Reform about?
In simple terms, the government is doing a massive
cleaning of the tax system.
For too long, the tax system has been messy, with
duplicated taxes and confusing regulations,
making it hard for tax payers to understand what
they need to do. This reform reorganises the entire
tax system to make life easier for everyone.
The reform has clear goals:
Make taxation simpler. You won’t need expert
knowledge of tax law to understand your
taxes.
Make taxation fairer so that the right people
pay the right amount.
Widen the tax base so that more people pay
taxes, reducing the burden on individuals.
Go fully digital to make tax compliance less
about paper and queues, and more about
structure and convenience.

There are four new tax laws
The tax reform isn’t a single law. It’s a group of
four new acts, each with a specific goal but
working together:
The Nigeria Tax Act (NTA): This explains
what is taxed, who should pay, and how much
they must pay.
The Nigeria Tax Administration Act (NTAA):
This focuses on the tax process - filing, paying,
and managing your taxes online.
The Nigeria Revenue Service Act (NRSA): This
empowers the tax office (currently known as
the FIRS) to do its job better and more fairly.
The Joint Revenue Board Act (JRBA): This
helps federal and state tax bodies work
together, so you’re less likely to be taxed twice
for the same thing.
What does the reform mean for you?
The changes to the tax system have different
impacts on salary earners and businesses.

The most significant changes here are to the
Personal Income Tax (PIT) system.
Clear exemption limit: If you earn ₦ 800,000 or
less per year, you won’t pay income tax. That’s
instant breathing room for low-income earners.
Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA): Targeted
reliefs now replace CRA. Instead of a blanket
allowance, you now get focused reliefs. For
example, you can claim 20% relief on your rent
(capped at ₦ 500,000).
Exemptions and deductions: Pension, housing,
and health insurance contributions are fully
deductible. The more you secure your future,
the less you pay now.
Electronic Money Transfer Levy (EMTL): This
levy is now transferred exclusively to states as
part of stamp duties. Small transfers are
exempted but large transfers may attract a
small levy.
If you’re a business owner or a freelancer
If you run an SME, freelance, or manage a side
hustle, the tax system now encourages you to grow
without squeezing you dry.
Corporate Income Tax (CIT): businesses with
turnover below ₦ 50 million annually now pay
zero corporate tax. That’s a big win for SMEs.
You are taxed on the income you earn, not on
the assets you own. For instance, if you have
one million naira in your current account,
there is no taxable income. But if that N1m is
moved to a savings account and earns 10%
interest, you'll pay tax on the 10% interest
earned, not the initial N1m.
Value Added Tax (VAT): still at 7.5%, but
invoicing goes digital, making calculations
automatic. Essentials like food, education, and
healthcare remain VAT-free.

Tax incentives: sectors like tech, agriculture,
and renewable energy get special breaks to
encourage growth.
Other good things you should know about:
FGN bonds & insurance: interest and payments
remain tax-free.
Retirement savings: contributions, growth, and
withdrawals - still tax-free.
Stocks: owning them isn’t taxed, though selling
for profit attracts tax on gains.
Rent relief: 20% off rent tax (up to ₦ 500,000).
Gifts & inheritance: still untaxed.
The message is clear: invest, grow, and formalise
your hustle without fear.
