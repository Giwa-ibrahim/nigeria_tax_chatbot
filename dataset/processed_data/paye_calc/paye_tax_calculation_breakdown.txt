### The Simple Rule

Think of your income as water filling up different buckets. Each bucket has a different tax rate. You fill the first bucket completely before moving to the next one.

---

### Tax Calculation (Step by Step)

1. **Bucket 1**: First ₦800,000

   * **Tax rate**: 0% (COMPLETELY FREE!)
   * **Tax**: ₦800,000 × 0% = ₦0
   * ✅ **This entire amount is yours to keep - no tax at all!**

2. **Bucket 2**: Next ₦2,200,000

   * **Tax rate**: 15%
   * **Tax**: ₦2,200,000 × 15% = ₦330,000
   * 💡 **Calculation**: 2,200,000 ÷ 100 × 15 = 330,000

3. **Bucket 3**: Next ₦1,000,000 (you partially fill this)

   * **Tax rate**: 18%
   * **Tax**: ₦1,000,000 × 18% = ₦180,000
   * 💡 **Calculation**: 1,000,000 ÷ 100 × 18 = 180,000
   * ℹ️ **You don't earn enough to fill this bucket completely**

---

### Total Annual Tax

* **Tax from Bucket 1**: ₦0
* **Tax from Bucket 2**: ₦330,000
* **Tax from Bucket 3**: ₦180,000
* **Total**: ₦510,000

### Detailed Math Breakdown

1. Start with your income: **₦4,000,000**
2. First ₦800,000 is tax-free

   * Remaining: ₦4,000,000 - ₦800,000 = ₦3,200,000
3. Next ₦2,200,000 is taxed at 15%

   * Tax = ₦2,200,000 × 0.15 = ₦330,000
   * Remaining: ₦3,200,000 - ₦2,200,000 = ₦1,000,000
4. Final ₦1,000,000 is taxed at 18%

   * Tax = ₦1,000,000 × 0.18 = ₦180,000
   * Remaining: ₦0 (all income accounted for)
5. Add up all taxes: ₦0 + ₦330,000 + ₦180,000 = ₦510,000
