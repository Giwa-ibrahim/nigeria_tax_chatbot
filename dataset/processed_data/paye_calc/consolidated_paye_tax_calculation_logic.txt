2. Key Changes from Previous Law

3. Taxable Income Formula
Taxable Income=Gross Annual Income−∑Eligible Deductions
✅ Six Eligible Deductions (must be documented):
Pension contribution (employee portion = 8% of basic + housing + transport)
NHF (National Housing Fund) = 2.5% of gross salary
NHIS (National Health Insurance Scheme) = 5% of basic salary (for firms with ≥10 employees)
Mortgage interest on owner-occupied residential property
Rent relief = lower of:
20% of annual rent paid, or
₦500,000
Life insurance premium paid for self or spouse
📌 All deductions require proof (e.g., payment receipts, policy documents). 
4. Progressive Tax Brackets (Annual)
Correct monthly threshold = ₦50,000,000 ÷ 12 = ₦4,166,666.67. 
5. Step-by-Step Calculation Example
Gross Annual Income = Assumed as ₦1,500,000; No Deductions
Gross Income: ₦1,500,000
Deductions: ₦0
Taxable Income: ₦1,500,000
Tax Computation:
₦800,000 × 0% = ₦0
(₦1,500,000 – ₦800,000) = ₦700,000 × 15% = ₦105,000
Annual PAYE: ₦105,000
Monthly PAYE: ₦105,000 ÷ 12 = ₦8,750
Effective Tax Rate: (₦105,000 ÷ ₦1,500,000) × 100 = 7.0%
🔸 Compared to old law (₦114,000 tax), taxpayer saves ₦9,000/year. 

6. Special Provisions & Exemptions
Minimum wage earners: Tax-exempt
Military officers: Tax-exempt
Employment compensation:
Up to ₦50 million → not taxable
Amounts above ₦50M → taxable
Independent contractors: Subject to 5% Withholding Tax (WHT), not PAYE
7. Employer & Payroll Compliance Notes
Pension: Employee = 8%, Employer = 10% (of basic + housing + transport)
NHF: Employee = 2.5% of gross salary (optional in private sector)
NHIS: Employee = 5%, Employer = 10% (for firms with ≥10 staff)
Rent & mortgage deductions require supporting documents
PAYE must be remitted monthly to FIRS or relevant State IRS
8. Summary of Benefits of New System
✅ Higher tax-free threshold (₦800k vs ~₦500k)
✅ Transparent, fixed tax bands (no complex CRA formula)
✅ Encourages formal savings (pension, NHF, NHIS)
✅ Easier compliance and audit trail
